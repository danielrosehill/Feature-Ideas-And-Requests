Hi VN team!

Here's a quick feature idea that popped into my mind.

Populating a personal dictionary of less common words that you use, or which speech-to-text models may commonly mistranscribe, is always challenging.

I would love to have a centralised one, but at the moment it usually involves me just putting the main suspects in to the list whenever I try out a new speech tool.

It's easy when looking at your transcribed notes, however, to spot trends and identify words that need to be "white listed".

Here is a feature idea that I thought would be a nice solution:

- User identifies a note with a mistranscribed word.
- user highlights that word.
- pop-up allows user to provide the correction.

Then, two things could happen:

- this note gets "fixed" 
- the word gets added to the personal dictionary.  

I reckon that if the user did this iteratively, you'd end up with a pretty comprehensive list of corrections - such that you might have to do this quite a lot at the start, but over time the effort and upkeep would diminish.
