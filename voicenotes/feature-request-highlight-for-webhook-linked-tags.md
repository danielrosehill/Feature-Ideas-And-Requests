Hi VN Team!

I'm making great use of the webhook feature!

One tiny thing that I noticed and I said I'd pass on the idea is that it's somewhat easy to accidentally trigger unintended automations.

A couple of ways this can happen:

\- You have a whole bunch of tags and forget which one you tied to a webhook/integration

\- The AI detection autotagged with a tag that fires a webhook event and you forgot to turn it off

My workaround is this: I add a label to my tags which are linked to webhooks and workflows (like this one for sending prompts into an agent) so that they stand out a bit in the tag list

It would be a really nice UI feature if those tags which were associated with active workflows had a distinctive CSS - like a background highlight shading:
