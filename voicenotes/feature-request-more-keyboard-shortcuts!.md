## Content

I'm using voice notes via a Chrome web app on Linux. So my shortcut list might not be the same as other platforms. Here's what I'm seeing right now:

There are a few more that would be useful which I'll leave here as suggestions:

**Show Shortcuts:**

Always handy to have a shortcut key to show the shortcut list itself! Especially when these are frequently changing

**Create X From Note:**

The create feature whereby you can convert a note into another format like an email is probably the most useful feature of this entire app for me. So it would be brilliant to be able to do that with a keyboard shortcut.

**Add Tags:**

Tagging is another very common function as well, maybe something like Ctrl + T then type your tags into an autocomplete field.

**Arrow Keys For Navigation:**

I imagine that many users like me are creating quite a significant amount of notes every day. being able to navigate up and down the list just with the keyboard for example up and down arrows would be very useful

**Batch Selection**

In a similar vein, being able to apply actions to multiple notes at the same time, like apply a common tag or create something from them would be very useful, although this is a non-keyboard feature request.

**Subnote:**

Don't use these that much personally but would like to do so a bit more to create fewer "deeper" notes. Could be a good candidate for a shortuct too.

# And These Would Be Amazing

This would be incredible:

The ability to create custom key bindings to generate specific common formats from your notes 

E.g.:

Ctrl + Meta + T = convert note into to do list

Ctrl + Meta + E = convert note into email 

Etc
