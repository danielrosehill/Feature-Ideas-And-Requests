Never got this message before so checked my recordings to see what the cause might be

I saw that I finally succumbed to whatever the desktop equivalent of "butt dialing is" and uploaded 4 hours worth of ... totally blank recordings!

Just as an idea: the only transcription that came through was hallucinated text.

Perhaps it might be possible to automate accidental recording detection through a logic like: if the recording is X long and includes Y words (where Y is far below what would be expected based on an average speaking pace multipled by the recording time) then notify user and deduct recording time from daily allotment.
