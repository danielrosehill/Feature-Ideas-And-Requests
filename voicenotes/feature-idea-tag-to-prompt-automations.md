Hi everyone!

This feature idea came to mind yesterday and I thought I would share it with the subreddit and team.

I find the custom prompts feature really valuable, particularly for taking text and putting it into a quite defined format such as a shopping list for the grocery store or a to-do list for a task manager or calendar. 

I also have tags set up for these entities as I'm creating them all the time. So I was thinking if I have the way to identify them and the prompt to reformat them, wouldn't it be useful if there was a way to link those together and automate it? 

The feature that I have in mind is something like finding tags with custom prompts in an automations section with the objective something like (using IFTTT language just to describe the idea):

IF a note has the tag 'Grocery list' THEN apply custom prompt 'Grocery List'

User could simply choose their tags and prompts from a dropdown to create the associations and have the automations in place.
