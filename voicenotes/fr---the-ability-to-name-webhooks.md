The webhook feature is great and so useful for automating stuff!

I'm experimenting with creating a few of them for tag-specific workflows (e.g. to-do list tags -> to do list processing workflow etc).

The UI issue is that when you have a lot of them it becomes impossible to see which webhook is which (should you wish to change the URL, deactivate, etc):

Suggested solution/ feature request:

Add an editable title field to the webhook so that users can give the webhooks descriptive names to enable editing.
