# FR:

Tags are a great feature and I find the AI autotagging works quite impressively well. Given that they are bound to webhooks, their value in automation is very significant.

Once you've been getting a lot of them however managing tags in a flat hierarchy and from within the confines of the current UI becomes very challenging.

Two things would help:

## Hierarchial Tags

the ability to nest tags within one another recursively and indefinitely.

## Tag Management Page

I feel like a lot of the elements which are currently only accessible through pop-ups would be much easier to use as self-standing pages. users have specific URLs that they can bookmark and it's just easier to manage information this way.

Page would be great for:

- Managing tags

- Managing webhooks
