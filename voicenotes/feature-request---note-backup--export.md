## Content

It would be really nice to be able to taken a backup of transcribed notes.

Two ways would been helpful:

FULL BACKUP

Allow users to export a simple zip archive containing either all their notes (since registration) or a time delimited selection of them.

ONGOING / INCREMENTAL

An ongoing incremental sync to a cloud storage like Google Drive would both add a great features and are redundancy.

USE CASE

I hate losing data and it can happen for the weirdest of reasons, including user error.

I always sleep easier when I know that I digital information I depend upon is in more than one place!
