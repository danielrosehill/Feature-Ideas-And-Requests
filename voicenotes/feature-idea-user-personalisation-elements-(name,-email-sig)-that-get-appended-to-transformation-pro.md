## Content

Dear Voice Notes team,

Here's another suggested feature that I think would greatly improve the email drafting process using Voice Notes. 

# Use-Case

Currently, while utilizing Voice Notes to create emails, I dictate my message and then apply a reformatting prompt. The functionality of this feature has significantly improved; however, one key limitation remains: the lack of integration with user-specific information.

# Suggested Feature

The proposed feature would allow users to provide personal details, such as their name and preferred email signature, which the system could then incorporate into the email drafts. This personalization would prevent the AI from having to start from scratch each time, avoiding the use of placeholders like "your name," which could potentially be missed and lead to embarrassing mistakes if not corrected by the user.

# Potential Benefits

\- Increased efficiency in creating personalized emails directly from Voice Notes, saving time for the user.

\- Reduction in the likelihood of errors resulting from placeholders not being updated.

\- A more seamless and streamlined email drafting experience, particularly beneficial for users who frequently rely on AI-assisted writing tools.

If integrated with the email system, this feature would enhance the productivity of users by automatically including personalized elements such as the user's signature, ensuring emails are ready to be sent without further editing.
