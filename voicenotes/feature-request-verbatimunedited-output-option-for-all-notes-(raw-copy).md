Hello Voicenotes team!

I saw that another commenter raised this issue, so for the purpose of putting down some SEO breadcrumbs and seeing what others think, I thought I would put this in a separate post because it's really quite an important one to me.

I was actually quite surprised to see that Voicenotes doesn't provide the option to receive the verbatim transcript of the notes. 

Maybe this was a once-off or bad luck thing (because I hadn't seen it before) but I recorded a 6-minute note, which is far longer than most of my recordings, and got back a very partial summary that missed a lot of the detail. It was a meeting minutes, so it was kind of necessary to get it all. I wasn't too nonplussed about the off-base summary, but *was* kind of disappointed to see that there was actually no fallback/ability to retrieve the original note in the UI. The botched summary was the only textual representation I could retrieved. 

Of course, in a pinch, one could go to the trouble of downloading the original recording and trying to transcribe it through a third-party app. But I'm guessing that that is not a behavior you really want to encourage and ... most users ... including me ... are more likely to just give up in frustration.

I think there's actually a pretty strong reason for including this feature - the main one being that it provides an important safeguard against the very real possibility of data loss for users. While the summarization seems to work for the most part, there are lots of hitches in all these AI tools, as we all know. And losing lots of detail in even one note is a pretty irritating experience that erodes a lot of trust in the product.

If this was just a fluke and there isn't some kind of processing going on by default, that's good. But it would be useful to get a bit of clarity on that. Namely ... when you don't use any form of creation prompt, is the model instructed just to return an unedited transcript, or is there some kind of light instructions going on?
