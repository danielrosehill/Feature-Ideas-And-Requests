One more FR:

# "The Problem"

Not really a problem, but for the sake of formatting this:

When using tools like this one tends to create a note which then needs a bit of editing in order to get it into a polished and usable format. 

However, webhooks are typically configured to execute immediately upon task completion.

This means that note captures which are not really ready yet will go into automations (for those using them).

# Potential Solutions

1: A system applied timeout of 5 minutes or so. At the expense of the integrations and automations not running immediately, users have a window of time to polyps the nodes before they get taken further 

2: Because every user is different, users have the ability to specify which webhook delay to use, which then gets applied to the automations.
