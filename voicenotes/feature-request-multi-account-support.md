## Use Case

I'm a solo business owner (consultancy). 

Over the years I've seen the value in separating personal and work files as meticulously as possible.

While it costs me more to maintain multiple accounts for the same service, I frequently do so to ensure that there's a clean separation between my personal notes (and life!) and stuff for clients. It also helps for billing: if I use something for work purposes (and its tax-deductible) I like to have a separate account. 

While I could easily try to "squish" everything into one account, I would rather not to so. do so.

## What I Would Like

I would like the ability to switch between two Voicenote accounts without needing to log in and log out and otherwise manage sessions "manually". A simple account switcher would suffice!

## Another Approach

An intermediate solution that would also work (although it would encourage users to cram in accounts!) is some top level taxonomy (perhaps 'workspace' - always popular or 'project'). Nest different types of notes (and tag taxonomies) under these different top level entity types.
