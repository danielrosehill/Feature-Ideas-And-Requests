Hi VN Team,

I'm sharing this here as I'm not sure that this *is* a bug in the first place or just a limitation of the integration as currently implemented. 

My wife has become a VN user and wishes to collect tasks via the app. I pointed her in the direction of the Todoist integration and the default task building setting.

For testing, I created an example task list making sure to include a task name, some details, and a date for both:

I have the integration configured (I'm a paid Todoist user). So I click Create -> Task List:

Voicenotes does a nice job and - minus misspelling omeprazole 'omeprazo' - it gets my list formatted:

I have 'smart date recognition' enabled in Todoist:

But here's how the tasks come through in Todoist:

What I would like (and have expected): voice notes populated by the integration behave the same as those captured via the app: elements like 'today',  'tomorrow' are detected as date entities and created accordingly.

Most ideally: the recognition logic would even extend to being able to break these two items down further in their hierarchy: task, task details, date.
