Context:

When recording voice notes in noisy environments using an external microphone (for example a Bluetooth headset) can make the difference between flawless transcription and very spotty ones. A quality Bluetooth headset remains a no-brainer investment for those serious about voice work. 

Problem:

Android is kind of finicky about Bluetooth audio permissions. Sometimes the most reliable way to ensure that your capturing from Bluetooth is when the app implemented. 

There's also a lot to be said for showing which device is in use as it can prevent poor quality transcriptions

Requested feature:

Input source selection with the ability to toggle between internal microphone and Bluetooth.

I can't think of a reason why a user who had a Bluetooth microphone would deliberately choose the phone mic, so mostly this would be for Bluetooth equipped users to ensure optimal microphone selection. 

Tip:

Not all voice note apps have implemented this but if memory serves Otter has. So
.. it's possible, I believe.
