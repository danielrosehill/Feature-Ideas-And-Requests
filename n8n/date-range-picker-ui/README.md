# UI Helper/Picker for Date Between (Date Range)

**Request Date:** July 31, 2025
**Source:** [n8n Community Forum](https://community.n8n.io/t/ui-helper-picker-for-date-between-ie-date-range/159853)
**Category:** Feature Requests / User Interface

## Overview

A request for a unified date range picker interface in n8n's UI to simplify filtering items based on date ranges in JSON data.

## Current Problem

When routing items based on JSON date values through the UI, users must use a cumbersome workaround: creating separate conditions for "date is after X" and "date is before Y." This forces users into awkward conditional logic rather than a streamlined date range selection.

While n8n already offers individual date picker elements that work well, there is no unified interface for defining date ranges in a single expression builder.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a dedicated date range picker that allows users to define both start and end dates within one unified interface, eliminating the need for multiple conditional statements.

## Benefits

- Simplifies date-based filtering logic
- Reduces complexity in workflow conditions
- Improves user experience by consolidating related date selections
- Leverages existing date picker UI components
- Makes workflows more readable and maintainable
