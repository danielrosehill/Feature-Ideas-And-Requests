# Easier Canvas Navigation: Arrow Nav, Minimap, Grab

**Request Date:** May 8, 2025
**Source:** [n8n Community Forum](https://community.n8n.io/t/easier-canvas-navigation-arrow-nav-minimap-grab/112541)
**Category:** Feature Requests / User Interface

## Overview

A request to improve workflow canvas navigation in n8n through the implementation of arrow key navigation and enhanced minimap accessibility. Canvas navigation is identified as a critical pain point that impacts the core functionality of the platform.

## Current Issues

The workflow canvas navigation experience has significant usability problems:

1. **No Arrow Key Support:** Arrow keys don't function for canvas navigation, which is counterintuitive for users expecting standard keyboard controls
2. **Minimap Accessibility:** The minimap only appears after zooming, requiring additional steps to adjust the viewport
3. **Complex Navigation:** Users find it difficult to quickly navigate large or complex workflows

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Arrow Key Navigation

Implement keyboard shortcuts for canvas movement:
- **Arrow Keys:** Directional canvas movement (up, down, left, right)
- **Zoom Controls:** Map2, Minus (+/-), and Plus keys for zoom in/out
- Standard keyboard-driven navigation patterns

### 2. Enhanced Minimap Accessibility

Improve minimap functionality:
- Allow users to undock and independently access the minimap
- Enable minimap access without toggling zoom levels
- Provide dedicated keyboard shortcuts for minimap operations
- Persistent minimap option for easier viewport management

## Benefits

- Improved workflow navigation efficiency
- Better user experience for complex workflows
- Reduced friction in daily workflow editing
- More intuitive controls aligned with user expectations
- Faster viewport adjustments and canvas traversal

## Visual References

The original request includes three screenshots showing:
1. A cluttered workflow canvas demonstrating navigation challenges
2. A specific node location the user wants to access
3. The minimap UI element being referenced

## Impact

Canvas navigation is fundamental to n8n's core functionality. These improvements would significantly enhance the daily workflow editing experience for all users, particularly those working with large or complex automation workflows.
