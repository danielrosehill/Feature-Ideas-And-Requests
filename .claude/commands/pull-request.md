Your task is to download a feature request that Daniel wrote and save it into the correct folder in the repository.

Use your fetch tool or Firebase. 

You do not need to capture metadata other than the request date. Organise the FR. If Daniel's FR contains typos, fix them so that this capture is an improved version.

If it contains images/screenshots, try to fetch them and create the FR as a folder with ./images and relative links and the FR as a markdown file. 

Follow whatever approach is needed so that the FRs captured contain all the accessory elements, where they exist.
