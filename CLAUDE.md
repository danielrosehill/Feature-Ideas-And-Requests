The purpose of this repository is to gather together feature requests/ideas for other services. It's a backup utility of sorts - way for me to gather up this data. I use it sparsely and mostly when it took a while to write and when it might have enduring value by providing the seeds for an implementation of my own. The folders divide by product. Many of these will be captured from Github so I may use a /grab-request slash command to ask you to retrieve an FR and save it into the relevant folder. Generate an index in readme periodically as the organisation and list of services will be periodicallyl updated.
