# Feature Ideas And Requests

 Sometimes I contribute feature requests and ideas to tech services that I use and love.

 I thought it might be worthwhile aggregating them in a Github repository so that in the future I can perhaps link to a specific markdown file here rather than scattering them in different places. 

 I'm going to try my best to keep these in a semi organized fashion. I'll bundle specific ideas for platforms into folders. And because these ideas might become outdated, I will also record the date in which I wrote them. 

 I may get around to thinking about a templated way for making feature
